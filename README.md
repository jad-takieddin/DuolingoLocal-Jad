💡 The Concept
Duolingo Local transforms cities into language classrooms through location-based real-world challenges at local venues and cafés. This feature bridges the gap between in-app practice and real-world confidence.
The Problem
Users practice in-app but struggle with real-world conversations, creating a gap between knowledge and practical confidence.
The Solution
Turn your city into a language classroom through location-based IRL challenges that combine learning with local exploration.

📱 Interactive Prototype
Experience the complete user journey through 5 interactive screens:

User Flow

Home - Entry point with "Local" tab notification
Discover - Interactive map showing nearby missions
Mission - Detailed challenge with hints and rewards
Proof - Photo capture for completion verification
Reward - XP, badges, and business coupons


🎯 Key Performance Indicators
Primary Metric: At-Risk Weekly Active User Retention Rate
Success Criteria:

🎯 >3% retention lift vs. control group (p < 0.05)
📊 Feature participation rate >20% in variant group

Why This Matters:
Duolingo's Growth Model shows that increasing CURR 2% month-over-month has the largest impact on DAUs, and most drop-offs occur in the first few weeks due to declining motivation.

🚀 Implementation Strategy
Validation Phases

Discovery (Week 0-1) - User interviews and usability testing
Intent Survey (Week 1-2) - 3,000-5,000 At-Risk users surveyed
Pilot (Week 3-8) - A/B testing in NYC & Toronto with 5,000 learners per city

Technical Requirements

Map Integration - Mapbox SDK for interactive missions
Photo Verification - ML infrastructure for image recognition
Rewards System - Merchant dashboard for local coupon integration
Location Access - Native mobile SDKs for geolocation


🛠️ Built With

React - Interactive UI components
